# 🛡️ Incident Response Policy — Organizational Cybersecurity Framework

# 📘 Overview

This repository contains a professionally developed Incident Response (IR) Policy designed to help organizations prepare for, detect, and respond to cybersecurity incidents efficiently and consistently.

The policy aligns with the NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide (SP 800-61r2) and ISO/IEC 27035 standards for incident management.
It defines management commitments, team roles, communication flows, and escalation procedures that enable a structured approach to handling security incidents — minimizing business disruption and data loss.

# 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a comprehensive and practical implementation of a cybersecurity governance document that can be directly applied in real-world enterprise environments.
It provides clarity on:
How incidents are identified, classified, and reported.
The roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder in the incident response lifecycle.
Escalation paths and authority levels during major incidents.
Internal and external communication requirements, including regulatory notifications.

# 🧩 Structure of the Policy

The Incident Response Policy is organized into the following sections:

Section	Description

- Statement of Management Commitment	Formal acknowledgment of executive support for incident response readiness and resources.

- Purpose of the Policy	Defines the intent and objectives guiding incident response within the organization.

- Objectives of the Policy	Outlines measurable goals such as minimizing downtime, preserving evidence, and improving detection capabilities.

- Scope of the Policy	Describes the systems, users, and data covered by the policy.

- Definition of Information Security Incidents	Provides clear definitions and examples of what constitutes an incident.

- Organizational Structure and Roles	Defines the Incident Response Team (IRT), including analysts, coordinators, and executives.

- Levels of Authority	Clarifies escalation thresholds and decision-making responsibilities.

- Reporting Requirements	Details internal escalation timelines and external regulatory or partner communication procedures.


# ⚙️ Framework Alignment

This policy framework aligns with:

NIST SP 800-61r2: Computer Security Incident Handling Guide

NIST CSF: Identify → Protect → Detect → Respond → Recover

ISO/IEC 27035: Information Security Incident Management

CIS Controls v8: Control 17 — Incident Response and Management


# 🧠 Learning Objectives

Through this project, I aimed to:

Demonstrate professional writing of a cybersecurity policy that mirrors enterprise standards.

Integrate incident response principles into a governance framework.

Create a baseline document that could be expanded into a full Incident Response Plan (IRP) and Playbook.

Showcase understanding of policy hierarchy, incident handling procedures, and cross-functional coordination during a cyber event.

# 🔍 Key Highlights

Built with NIST/ISO best practices.

Clearly delineates management accountability and escalation flows.

Integrates with potential technical controls such as SIEM, SOC, and SOAR platforms.

Ready for adaptation into incident-specific playbooks (e.g., ransomware, unauthorized access, data breach scenarios).


# 💼 Use Case

This policy serves as a foundational artifact for organizations developing or maturing their cybersecurity governance framework.
It can be used to:
Support cybersecurity audits or ISO 27001 readiness assessments.
Train new SOC or IR team members.
Form the governance backbone of a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan (CIRP).

# 🧠 Future Enhancements

In future updates, I plan to:
Add Incident Response Playbooks for:
Unauthorized Access
Malware Infection
Physical Intrusion
Integrate a Policy Compliance Checklist based on CIS Control 17 and ISO 27035.
Add Kibana and Security Onion correlation examples to link policy with technical monitoring.

# 📢 Author’s Note

This project demonstrates my capability to translate technical security operations and incident response processes into policy level governance documentation that is both actionable and audit ready.
It reflects my academic and professional development in cybersecurity, incident management, and risk governance.
